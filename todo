repair breaker.ts: 
  when there is conflict between breaks (short break was trying to start while long break is already not finished)
  the short break timer is not started ever again since `startShortBreakInterval()` was not invoked after the long break ending
reset the short break timer after taking the long break so it won't be annoying

  add counter for system time up
