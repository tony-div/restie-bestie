# Restie Bestie
## a simple desktop app to remind you to take a break away from your pc to avoid back pain and eye strain
### once you open it you will see timers counting down for your break and when it is time to rest an always-on-top dialog will show up with a timer for your rest to come back after it ends
for now I just wanted to mention that the app icon is generated by gemini and was edited by pixlr
